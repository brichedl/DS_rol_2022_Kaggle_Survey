# DS_rol_2022_Kaggle_Survey

Data has become an international business and most companies are clamoring to make use of the vast amount of data that is generated every day. On the other hand, there are communities such as Kaggle, a community platform for data science and machine learning. This platform is globally accessible and has a large community of data scientists, enthusiasts and companies that participate in its competitions, collaborate on projects and share knowledge. It has important collaborators such as Microsoft, Google, Intel, Booz Allen Hamilton, Databricks, among others. As of July 2023, it remains one of the first platforms in education, allowing platform participants to be part of challenges and competitions associated with data.

Kaggle was founded in 2010, its main headquarters is in the United States. Google acquired Kaggle in 2017 and since then every year it conducts a survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning [2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017). In this paper we will analyze the latest survey done to the current date, called 2022 Kaggle DS & ML Survey. Aiming to leverage the data obtained by the community and draw conclusions about demographics, industry of participation and preferred technologies in the area of data science.

The data obtained from the Kaggle DS & ML 2022 Survey have been used in several reports with different approaches. For example, users were ranked to analyze which regions and countries are developed, developing, or lagging in the field of data science and machine learning [3](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rosspmcdonald/classifying-users-and-learning-from-experts). Another report focused on whether organizations and governments were ready for data culture and artificial intelligence adoption [4](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivamb/data-science-in-2021-adaptation-or-adoption/notebook). In addition, an analysis of the state of machine learning adoption in enterprises by 2022 was conducted [5](https://www.kaggle.com/code/eraikako/data-science-and-mlops-landscape-in-industry). Additionally, comparative and country-by-country analysis was conducted to identify factors such as gender ratio, age, education, among others [6](https://www.kaggle.com/code/michau96/15-factors-for-data-science-in-your-country). The survey data has provided valuable insights into the community using Kaggle and how data adoption is approached in various industries.

In the field of data science, it is vital to understand the demographics, industry distribution and technologies preferred by experts in the most active countries within the Kaggle community. These five countries represent an important hub of data science knowledge and development, and knowing the demographics of their experts, the industries that demand the most talent, and the tools most used is essential to identifying patterns, trends, and growth opportunities in this evolving field. What is the picture that emerges in terms of demographics, industry participation, and preferred technologies in the data science role in these leading Kaggle countries?

# Results 

Categorizing experts based on their data science role, a geographical classification was also conducted focusing on the top 5 countries with the highest representation in the Kaggle community. These countries are the United States, India, Others, Brazil, and Japan, with a total of 548 surveyed users, representing approximately 28.87% of the total users, as shown in Figure.

* The differences in gender distribution in the data science community in each country and highlight the importance of promoting gender diversity in this professional area.
* This indicates that the vast majority of respondents have at least one higher education study, reaching 92.3% of the total number of participants.
* The industry with the most data science representatives is Computers/Technology, corresponding to 32.12% of the population and the Accounts/Finance industry with  equivalent to 10.04% of the total.
* 92.71% of Kaggle users who are data scientists classified as experts, indicated from the companies in which they work to have some kind of contact with machine learning methods.
* The variations in salaries may be related to the economic situation and hiring policies of each country, which could generate differences in the remuneration of expert data scientists. for examplo Average salary ranges USA: $ 59.860 , India: $ 7.000 , Brasil: $ 15.000 , Japón: $ 45.000
* The following activities are related to the use of machine learning: prototyping for application in new areas, experimentation and iteration of ML models to improve existing models, and building or running a machine learning service to operationally improve products or workflows. These last activities are performed by more than 50% of the surveyed users.
